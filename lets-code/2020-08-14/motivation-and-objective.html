    <h1>Let's Code! - 2020-08-14</h1>
    <h2>Motivation and objective</h2>
    <p>
        I am a self taught programmer and have been earning a living as a
        freelancer or running a small software company for some 20 years. I also
        love to teach and find ways to simplify complex subjects. And I've had
        an interest in teaching programming for some time. My ultimate goal is
        to teach those that might want to earn a living as computer programmers
        or use their newly found skills to launch their own software ideas. But
        before I can do that I have to develop my skills teaching the subject
        and polish the concepts that I have in mind. And that's where you come
        in.
    </p>
    <h2>Real world programming</h2>
    <p>
        Far too many times to be a coincidence I've worked with college
        graduates that were simply not ready for real world programming. I can't
        really explain it. All I can say is that the vast, if not all, of what
        I've learned has been by reading and then applying what I've read. I
        learned by doing. That is what I'd like to offer the group, the
        opportunity to learn by doing or seeing how it is done in the real
        world. We won't spend too much time with theory or discussing how things
        work behind the scenes. I ultimately want this to be about getting
        things done.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, I realize this is a very diverse group. And your reasons for
        joining the group might not perfectly align with my ultimate goals.
        That's okay. All I want to do at this time is learn how to best teach
        some of the concepts that I have in mind. And I appreciate your help in
        that regard.
    </p>
    <h2>When and How</h2>
    <p>
        Our first live meeting will be Monday the 24th at 7:30 pm Eastern
        Daylight Time (-4 GMT). I plan on having up to two sessions of no more
        than an hour and a half per week (the other will likely be Sunday nights
        but I'm open to suggestions). My goal is for each session to conclude
        with a working program. We may do the same program several times in
        different ways and with various degrees of quality. So it is okay if
        you miss a session here and there. And yes, we will eventually get to
        build a Zoom like app.
    </p>
    <p>
        I will likely record each session so that I can review my performance
        and see where I can improve. I may also make them available online for
        others to learn from. Please private message me to discuss if this is an
        issue and I'll try to address any concern that you may have.
    </p>
    <p>
        To be clear, this is not a course per se. It does not have a fixed end
        date. After all, I'm still learning about programming myself - even
        after all this time. I will continue to do this as long as there is
        interest, circumstances permit, and while I develop my teaching skills.
        I'm kinda slow. So it may take a while ðŸ™‚
    </p>
    <p>
        In the meantime I will soon be sending your first exercise that will
        test your ability to give precise and clear instructions.
