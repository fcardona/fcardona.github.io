    <h1>Let's Code!</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Before I let you all in on what I have in mind let me share a few
        thoughts that are at the core of my thinking regarding computer
        programming...
    </p>
    <h3>Most people have the ability to learn programming</h3>
    <p>
        So it is not a question of whether a person can learn how to program, it
        is a question of whether they'd like it enough to stick with it to the
        point that they can create software for themselves or develop a
        marketable skill.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Programming is much like learning the foreign language of a people with
        a totally foreign culture
    </h3>
    <p>
        I'm not much into Stark Trek but I suppose we can liken computers
        Vulcans in how they are governed by logic. It is your job to convey
        instructions to it in a logical way because computers will do exactly
        what you tell them to do; nothing more and nothing less. I guess they
        are also much like Noah in that they do "just so".
    </p>
    <h3>
        Natural languages are very imprecise
    </h3>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, English (as most if not all natural languages) is very
        imprecise. For example, take the statement "the man looked at the lady
        with the telescope". At first glance you might think you understand that
        statement. But question: who has the telescope? Take your time and think
        carefully. We'd love for you to post your answer in the WhatsApp group
        before selecting the answer below.
    </p>
    <p>
        <input type="radio" id="man" name="personWithTelescope" value="man" onclick="showAnswer();">
        <label for="man">the man</label><br>
        <input type="radio" id="lady" name="personWithTelescope" value="lady" onclick="showAnswer();">
        <label for="lady">lady</label><br>
    </p>
    <p id="answer-to-who-has-the-telescope">
        The reality is that the statement is too ambiguous to positively
        identify who has the telescope. The man could have been using the
        telescope to look at the lady or the man could have been looking at the
        lady who happened to have the telescope in her hand.

        Because natural languages are so imprecise we can't use them to
        communicate with computers. We need languages that don't leave any room
        for ambiguity in the instructions we are trying to give the computer.
        That is where computer languages come in. And there are hundreds of
        them; each with their pros and cons.
    </p>
    <h3>Learning by doing</h3>
    <p>
        I took one year of French in high school. The teacher insisted that we
        spend the whole year learning to read and write French, conjugate verbs,
        and the like. The second year we were to start actually speaking the
        language. Needless to say, I didn't learn French ðŸ˜¢

        Instead of a having something structured like they do in schools with
        lesson plans and all, I would like this to be more like learning a
        language by moving to the a foreign country and being immersed in the
        culture. I guess it's more like learn by doing, or watching someone else
        (namely me) do it.
    </p>
    <p>
        So far I think we have friends from Bolivia, Mexico, Philippines, Puerto
        Rico, and the United States. Some here are starting from zero while
        others make a living as computer programmers. The reasons for being here
        also vary greatly - some to learn to program, others to practice
        English, etc. I hope the whole thing ends up being informative to those
        that are learning and at the very least entertaining to the veterans.

        The next thing we need to do may be the most challenging. When can we
        have our first Zoom meeting to get started? Perhaps we should begin by
        letting the WhatsApp group know when we each have our midweek, and
        weekend meetings. When you do please let us know your time zone. Thanks!
    </p>
